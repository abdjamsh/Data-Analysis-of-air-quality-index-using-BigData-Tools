# Data-Analysis-of-air-quality-index-using-BigData-Tools
we infer real-time and detailed information regarding the air quality throughout the city of SOFIA based on pollutants and meteorological data (historical and real-time)reported by the existing monitoring stations.All these types of inputs fed the system, which uses an advanced computational module for analyzing and extracting needed information through the use of a set of algorithms and online analytical processing(OLAP)tools.The advanced features of an air quality management system are necessary and expected to be helpful to stakeholders, planners and decision makers, so that they can reliably generate a statement and prevision on the air quality, simulate and analyze more information in the decision making process. Here we use map reduce to retrieve top 5 pollutted cities in sofia which is a state in BULGARIA. We will query the the results from HDFS using HIVE and visualize the results in TABLEAU.
